            <h2>My Programming Experience</h2>
                <p>My journey with programming is still at an early stage, but it has already given me valuable skills and experiences that I want to keep building on. So far, my background includes both formal education and self-learning, which together have shaped the way I approach coding and problem-solving.</p>
            <h3>Learning C++ at University</h3>
                <p>My first real introduction to programming came during my studies at a Spanish university, where I learned C++. This was my starting point in understanding how programming languages work. With C++, I discovered concepts like variables, loops, and functions, but also got a taste of more complex ideas such as memory management and object-oriented programming.</p>
                <p>Working with C++ was sometimes challenging, but it gave me a strong foundation in logic and structured thinking. It also made me realize how important it is to break down problems into smaller parts and to approach programming in a step-by-step manner.</p>
            <h3>HTML and CSS Through Self-Learning</h3>
                <p>Outside of formal education, I became curious about web development, so I started teaching myself HTML and CSS. I used YouTube tutorials as my main learning resource, and I quickly realized how much fun it is to see immediate results from writing code — building websites, styling pages, and experimenting with layouts.</p>
                <p>To practice, I worked on small personal projects at home, such as simple websites and design experiments. These projects helped me not only practice what I had learned but also explore my creativity by testing out different styles and ideas.</p>
            <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
                <p>Even though my programming experience so far is limited to C++ from university and HTML/CSS through self-study, these experiences have motivated me to keep learning more. I now have a taste of both back-end programming and front-end web development, and I’m excited to expand my skills further in other areas of ICT.</p>
                <p>My next goal is to explore more programming languages, frameworks, and tools so I can gain a broader understanding of how software and web development come together. I see programming not just as a technical skill but also as a creative tool to solve problems and bring ideas to life.</p>
