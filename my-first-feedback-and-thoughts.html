            <h2>My First Feedback and My Thoughts</h2>
                <p>Before starting my degree, I had to complete an assignment that was meant to help me reflect on my study choice, my strengths, weaknesses, and my goals for the future. After submitting this assignment, I received my first feedback, and I think it was a very important moment because it gave me a clear idea of what to expect from the program and how I could already start improving.</p>
                <p>The feedback was mainly focused on the way I structured my answers and how I expressed my ideas. It showed me that I had good reflections and that I understood myself quite well, but also that I could try to be more detailed in certain parts. For example, when I talked about my study choice or my career goals, the advice was to give more concrete examples and to explain why those choices were meaningful to me. This helped me see that sometimes I tend to keep things too general, while going into more detail would make my answers stronger and clearer.</p>
                <p>My first reaction to the feedback was positive. I didn’t see it as criticism but more as guidance. It made me realize that feedback is not just about pointing out mistakes, but about showing me ways to grow and improve. I also liked that the comments were constructive, because they didn’t just say “this part is weak” — they explained what I could do to make it better.</p>
                <p>Overall, I think this first feedback experience was very valuable. It reminded me that studying at university is not only about learning new subjects but also about developing skills like self-reflection, communication, and critical thinking. It also motivated me to take feedback seriously from the very beginning, because I know that being open to it will help me a lot throughout my degree.</p>
