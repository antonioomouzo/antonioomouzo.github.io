            <h2>My Study Choice Journey</h2>
                <p>Choosing the right study program has been an important step for me, and I want to share how I approached it and what I see for myself in the future.</p>
            <h3>My background</h3>
                <p>In my prior education, I followed the Technological Sciences profile. This gave me a solid base in technical subjects and helped me strengthen my problem-solving and analytical skills. I also already studied at a university of applied sciences, which gave me a good impression of higher education and what it means to connect theory with practice.</p>

            <h2>My Personal SWOT Analysis</h2>
                <p>Doing a SWOT analysis of myself has helped me better understand my strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. It’s a useful way to reflect on where I am right now and where I want to go in the future, especially in my studies and career.</p>
            <h3>Strengths</h3>
                <p>One of my strongest qualities is teamwork. I’ve been working on projects and group assignments for most of my life, both in Spain and with the Erasmus school group. These experiences not only taught me how to collaborate but also gave me the chance to develop new skills, such as 3D design with CAD.</p>
                <p>I also believe I’m good at adapting to the people I work with. For me, the key to achieving great results is to make sure that everyone feels comfortable and motivated. That’s why I always try my best to encourage and support my teammates. I see this positive attitude as a way to help the whole group succeed together.</p>

            <h2>My Programming Experience</h2>
                <p>My journey with programming is still at an early stage, but it has already given me valuable skills and experiences that I want to keep building on. So far, my background includes both formal education and self-learning, which together have shaped the way I approach coding and problem-solving.</p>
            <h3>Learning C++ at University</h3>
                <p>My first real introduction to programming came during my studies at a Spanish university, where I learned C++. This was my starting point in understanding how programming languages work. With C++, I discovered concepts like variables, loops, and functions, but also got a taste of more complex ideas such as memory management and object-oriented programming.</p>
                <p>Working with C++ was sometimes challenging, but it gave me a strong foundation in logic and structured thinking. It also made me realize how important it is to break down problems into smaller parts and to approach programming in a step-by-step manner.</p>

            <h2>My First Feedback and Thoughts</h2>
                <p>Before starting my degree, I had to complete an assignment that was meant to help me reflect on my study choice, my strengths, weaknesses, and my goals for the future. After submitting this assignment, I received my first feedback, and I think it was a very important moment because it gave me a clear idea of what to expect from the program and how I could already start improving.</p>
                <p>The feedback was mainly focused on the way I structured my answers and how I expressed my ideas. It showed me that I had good reflections and that I understood myself quite well, but also that I could try to be more detailed in certain parts. For example, when I talked about my study choice or my career goals, the advice was to give more concrete examples and to explain why those choices were meaningful to me. This helped me see that sometimes I tend to keep things too general, while going into more detail would make my answers stronger and clearer.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the ICT Field: What’s Out There</h2>
                <p>I’ve been thinking a lot about the real-world landscape of ICT careers, and I came across some interesting insights that really helped shape my understanding. Here’s my take on the current state of the field and its most promising paths.</p>
                    <h3>Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning</h3>
                        <p>AI isn’t just hype—it’s driving transformation across industries. AI and ML engineers, who build and train intelligent models for automation, analytics, and more, are in high demand. These roles require skills in Python and a knack for solving complex problems. From what I’ve gathered, the demand for AI engineers remains one of the strongest in ICT right now. </p>
                    <h3>Cybersecurity Specialists</h3>
                        <p>With cyber threats growing more sophisticated and frequent, cybersecurity experts are more essential than ever. They work on protecting data, responding to incidents, and enforcing security protocols. There’s a real skills shortage in this area, which makes it a stable and rewarding path for the future. </p>
