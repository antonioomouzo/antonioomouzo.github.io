            <h2>My Study Choice Journey</h2>
                <p>Choosing the right study program has been an important step for me, and I want to share how I approached it and what I see for myself in the future.</p>
            <h3>My background</h3>
                <p>In my prior education, I followed the Technological Sciences profile. This gave me a solid base in technical subjects and helped me strengthen my problem-solving and analytical skills. I also already studied at a university of applied sciences, which gave me a good impression of higher education and what it means to connect theory with practice.</p>
            <h3>Study choice activities</h3>
                <p>When it came to exploring my study options, I didn’t take part in every activity available, like open days or trial study days. Instead, I focused on one activity that I found most useful: I had a chat with a student via <a href="https://hz.nl" alt="HZ University of Applied Sciences">hz.nl</a>. Talking directly with a student gave me honest insights into the program, the daily life of studying, and the challenges I could expect. That conversation helped me picture myself in the program much more clearly than anything else.</p>
            <h3>My future plans</h3>
                <p>After completing my ICT degree, I see myself working in a role that is both challenging and rewarding. My first choices are becoming a Cybersecurity Specialist or an IT Project Manager, since I really like the idea of protecting systems, managing projects, and finding solutions to complex problems.</p>
                <p>At the same time, I would also enjoy working as a Data Engineer or Software Developer. Each of these professions has something exciting that attracts me, whether it’s working with data, building applications, or ensuring digital security.</p>
                <p>In four years, I hope to have gained not only the technical knowledge I need, but also the ability to adapt to new technologies, think critically, and work well in teams. My goal is to graduate with the confidence and skills to make a real contribution to the ICT world.</p>

        <article class="swot">
            <h2>My Personal SWOT Analysis</h2>
                <p>Doing a SWOT analysis of myself has helped me better understand my strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. It’s a useful way to reflect on where I am right now and where I want to go in the future, especially in my studies and career.</p>
            <h3>Strengths</h3>
                <p>One of my strongest qualities is teamwork. I’ve been working on projects and group assignments for most of my life, both in Spain and with the Erasmus school group. These experiences not only taught me how to collaborate but also gave me the chance to develop new skills, such as 3D design with CAD.</p>
                <p>I also believe I’m good at adapting to the people I work with. For me, the key to achieving great results is to make sure that everyone feels comfortable and motivated. That’s why I always try my best to encourage and support my teammates. I see this positive attitude as a way to help the whole group succeed together.</p>
            <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
                <p>On the other hand, one of my weaknesses is that I’m quite introverted. At first, I can come across as shy, especially when I don’t know people well yet. However, once I feel comfortable and build trust with my classmates or teammates, this shyness tends to fade away.</p>
                <p>Another weakness is that I can sometimes be too disciplined or perfectionistic. While discipline helps me stay focused, perfectionism can also create unnecessary pressure. This sometimes leads to stress or disappointment if things don’t go exactly as I expected.</p>
            <h3>Opportunities</h3>
                <p>I see several opportunities ahead of me. One important opportunity is the way this university works: it allows students to earn different certificates during their studies. These certificates can make a big difference later on, as they will give me an advantage in the job market and help me connect with a wider range of companies.</p>
                <p>Another opportunity I find very exciting is the chance to study abroad, either for a few months or even a year. I don’t know all the details about the options yet, but I would definitely welcome the possibility to go to another country, meet new people, and work with them. I think this would help me grow not only as a professional but also as a person, by learning from new perspectives and approaches.</p>
            <h3>Threats</h3>
                <p>When I think about possible threats, one of my concerns is the risk of struggling to understand the material quickly and sometimes feeling lost during class. This is something I will need to manage carefully by staying proactive and asking for help when needed.</p>
                <p>Another possible challenge is adapting to a new lifestyle. This isn’t directly connected to ICT itself, but rather to adjusting to things like the culture, the weather, or the overall way of living in a new environment. That said, I don’t expect this to be a major problem for me, as I’m usually able to adapt and make the best out of new situations.</p>

            <h2>My Programming Experience</h2>
                <p>My journey with programming is still at an early stage, but it has already given me valuable skills and experiences that I want to keep building on. So far, my background includes both formal education and self-learning, which together have shaped the way I approach coding and problem-solving.</p>
            <h3>Learning C++ at University</h3>
                <p>My first real introduction to programming came during my studies at a Spanish university, where I learned C++. This was my starting point in understanding how programming languages work. With C++, I discovered concepts like variables, loops, and functions, but also got a taste of more complex ideas such as memory management and object-oriented programming.</p>
                <p>Working with C++ was sometimes challenging, but it gave me a strong foundation in logic and structured thinking. It also made me realize how important it is to break down problems into smaller parts and to approach programming in a step-by-step manner.</p>
            <h3>HTML and CSS Through Self-Learning</h3>
                <p>Outside of formal education, I became curious about web development, so I started teaching myself HTML and CSS. I used YouTube tutorials as my main learning resource, and I quickly realized how much fun it is to see immediate results from writing code — building websites, styling pages, and experimenting with layouts.</p>
                <p>To practice, I worked on small personal projects at home, such as simple websites and design experiments. These projects helped me not only practice what I had learned but also explore my creativity by testing out different styles and ideas.</p>
            <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
                <p>Even though my programming experience so far is limited to C++ from university and HTML/CSS through self-study, these experiences have motivated me to keep learning more. I now have a taste of both back-end programming and front-end web development, and I’m excited to expand my skills further in other areas of ICT.</p>
                <p>My next goal is to explore more programming languages, frameworks, and tools so I can gain a broader understanding of how software and web development come together. I see programming not just as a technical skill but also as a creative tool to solve problems and bring ideas to life.</p>

        <article class="first-feedback">
            <h2>My First Feedback and My Thoughts</h2>
                <p>Before starting my degree, I had to complete an assignment that was meant to help me reflect on my study choice, my strengths, weaknesses, and my goals for the future. After submitting this assignment, I received my first feedback, and I think it was a very important moment because it gave me a clear idea of what to expect from the program and how I could already start improving.</p>
                <p>The feedback was mainly focused on the way I structured my answers and how I expressed my ideas. It showed me that I had good reflections and that I understood myself quite well, but also that I could try to be more detailed in certain parts. For example, when I talked about my study choice or my career goals, the advice was to give more concrete examples and to explain why those choices were meaningful to me. This helped me see that sometimes I tend to keep things too general, while going into more detail would make my answers stronger and clearer.</p>
                <p>My first reaction to the feedback was positive. I didn’t see it as criticism but more as guidance. It made me realize that feedback is not just about pointing out mistakes, but about showing me ways to grow and improve. I also liked that the comments were constructive, because they didn’t just say “this part is weak” — they explained what I could do to make it better.</p>
                <p>Overall, I think this first feedback experience was very valuable. It reminded me that studying at university is not only about learning new subjects but also about developing skills like self-reflection, communication, and critical thinking. It also motivated me to take feedback seriously from the very beginning, because I know that being open to it will help me a lot throughout my degree.</p>
