*Dashboard development*

Search:

Structure:
-   Based on an html table.
-   Same background, maintain uniformity.
-   Upside the table with all the 1st quarter components known.
-   Add selectors with placeholders on a "status" column in order to fill them in easily.
-   Downside the "NBSA boundary bar" so it updates whenever I get ecs to show in a visual way how is it going and how many ecs still left for that boundary and for the total ecs.
-   So 2 parts, the table and the bar.
