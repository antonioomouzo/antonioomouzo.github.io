            <h2>My Study Choice Journey</h2>
                <p>Choosing the right study program has been an important step for me, and I want to share how I approached it and what I see for myself in the future.</p>
            <h3>My background</h3>
                <p>In my prior education, I followed the Technological Sciences profile. This gave me a solid base in technical subjects and helped me strengthen my problem-solving and analytical skills. I also already studied at a university of applied sciences, which gave me a good impression of higher education and what it means to connect theory with practice.</p>
            <h3>Study choice activities</h3>
                <p>When it came to exploring my study options, I didn’t take part in every activity available, like open days or trial study days. Instead, I focused on one activity that I found most useful: I had a chat with a student via <a href="https://hz.nl" alt="HZ University of Applied Sciences">hz.nl</a>. Talking directly with a student gave me honest insights into the program, the daily life of studying, and the challenges I could expect. That conversation helped me picture myself in the program much more clearly than anything else.</p>
            <h3>My future plans</h3>
                <p>After completing my ICT degree, I see myself working in a role that is both challenging and rewarding. My first choices are becoming a Cybersecurity Specialist or an IT Project Manager, since I really like the idea of protecting systems, managing projects, and finding solutions to complex problems.</p>
                <p>At the same time, I would also enjoy working as a Data Engineer or Software Developer. Each of these professions has something exciting that attracts me, whether it’s working with data, building applications, or ensuring digital security.</p>
                <p>In four years, I hope to have gained not only the technical knowledge I need, but also the ability to adapt to new technologies, think critically, and work well in teams. My goal is to graduate with the confidence and skills to make a real contribution to the ICT world.</p>
