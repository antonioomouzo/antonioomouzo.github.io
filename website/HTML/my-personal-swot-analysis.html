            <h2>My Personal SWOT Analysis</h2>
                <p>Doing a SWOT analysis of myself has helped me better understand my strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. It’s a useful way to reflect on where I am right now and where I want to go in the future, especially in my studies and career.</p>
            <h3>Strengths</h3>
                <p>One of my strongest qualities is teamwork. I’ve been working on projects and group assignments for most of my life, both in Spain and with the Erasmus school group. These experiences not only taught me how to collaborate but also gave me the chance to develop new skills, such as 3D design with CAD.</p>
                <p>I also believe I’m good at adapting to the people I work with. For me, the key to achieving great results is to make sure that everyone feels comfortable and motivated. That’s why I always try my best to encourage and support my teammates. I see this positive attitude as a way to help the whole group succeed together.</p>
            <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
                <p>On the other hand, one of my weaknesses is that I’m quite introverted. At first, I can come across as shy, especially when I don’t know people well yet. However, once I feel comfortable and build trust with my classmates or teammates, this shyness tends to fade away.</p>
                <p>Another weakness is that I can sometimes be too disciplined or perfectionistic. While discipline helps me stay focused, perfectionism can also create unnecessary pressure. This sometimes leads to stress or disappointment if things don’t go exactly as I expected.</p>
            <h3>Opportunities</h3>
                <p>I see several opportunities ahead of me. One important opportunity is the way this university works: it allows students to earn different certificates during their studies. These certificates can make a big difference later on, as they will give me an advantage in the job market and help me connect with a wider range of companies.</p>
                <p>Another opportunity I find very exciting is the chance to study abroad, either for a few months or even a year. I don’t know all the details about the options yet, but I would definitely welcome the possibility to go to another country, meet new people, and work with them. I think this would help me grow not only as a professional but also as a person, by learning from new perspectives and approaches.</p>
            <h3>Threats</h3>
                <p>When I think about possible threats, one of my concerns is the risk of struggling to understand the material quickly and sometimes feeling lost during class. This is something I will need to manage carefully by staying proactive and asking for help when needed.</p>
                <p>Another possible challenge is adapting to a new lifestyle. This isn’t directly connected to ICT itself, but rather to adjusting to things like the culture, the weather, or the overall way of living in a new environment. That said, I don’t expect this to be a major problem for me, as I’m usually able to adapt and make the best out of new situations.</p>
